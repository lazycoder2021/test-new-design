                    <p>In this article, let’s go back to the page you were confronted with when you signed up – the Microsoft 365 admin center, and understand how it works and what you can do with it.</p>
                    <p><b>Note:</b> This guide directly took you to the Microsoft 365 home page first because some users – especially beginners – can find it hard to work on admin tasks right away. Moreover, this is just going to be a brief overview to get you started. In-depth articles will soon follow. So keep an eye on this Microsoft 365 for Beginners series!</p>
                    <p>If you recollect, your welcome page would have looked like the one shown in Figure 2. You can still access it by clicking the admin tab in the left pane as shown in Figure 1.</p>
                    <div class="img-section">

                    <p>The welcome admin page can be broadly classified into four important sections:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="link-li">
                            <b>The main page:</b> lets you add users and reset their passwords; offers recommended activities for your organization; and has five different tabs (under Your organization section) that help you get started with Microsoft 365.
                        </li>
                        <li class="link-li">
                            <b>Navigation menu:</b> this helps you navigate through the various sections within your admin center like Users, Teams & groups, Billing, Setup, etc., (The number of menus or sections appearing can be overwhelming at first. But do not worry, everything will be explained to you in detail).

                            <b>The search bar:</b> a contextual search bar that helps you navigate to different admin sections and directs you to actions that you might want to perform as an administrator.
                        </li>
                        <li class="link-li">
                            <b>Utility icons:</b> that help you deal with routine and useful operations like viewing notifications, personalizing the Microsoft 365 settings, signing out of Microsoft 365, etc.,
